# A failed project
## Application was build a while ago but i was not optimistic to push it. 
## Published time 27 jan 2024
## play Store Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sarrast.tasker
### I am not paying openAI for model so responses are not coming but ocr is functional and UI is ok i guess...
## I might hit back after a while with my learnings from failure


# why i am sharing this
## my real challange was to build the expo codebase.
## i resolved most of the build issues that were not on the web, i backtracked a lot of things and it took me about a month to resolve issues.
 ### i don't remember exactly  but one thing that stuck with me is.
  #### keep your config files under observation when building, Even android(build folder) configs itself (not only expo configs)
